# Java Practice Repo

This repository contains practice programs for Java, structured into branches and folders:

- **start** → basic programs (Hello World, input/output)
- **variable-datatype** → variables, datatypes, type casting
- **conditional** → if-else, switch case problems
- **loop** → for, while, do-while problems

Each topic is maintained in its own branch for clarity.
